## About Autodesk AutoCAD

Developed by **Autodesk**, AutoCAD has set the global standard for CAD drafting and documentation for over 40 years. Its flexibility and accuracy make it essential across **architecture, engineering, construction, and manufacturing**.  

AutoCAD supports both **2D documentation** and **3D modeling workflows**, giving professionals the tools to move from concept to fabrication seamlessly. With its parametric constraints, you can maintain full geometric relationships and update designs dynamically.  

The platform’s **DWG-native format** ensures smooth collaboration across teams and industries. Whether you’re designing a building, mechanical part, or electrical schematic, AutoCAD combines clarity, automation, and power in one system.
